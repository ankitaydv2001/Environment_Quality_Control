What Is Air Pollution?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
The Clean Air Act authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect public health by regulating the emissions of these harmful air pollutants. The NRDC has been a leading authority on this law since it was established in 1970.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
What Causes Air Pollution?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
“Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air Project, part of the Climate and Clean Energy program at NRDC. “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says. “Another type of air pollution is then worsened by that increased heat: Smog forms when the weather is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate change also increases the production of allergenic air pollutants including mold (thanks to damp conditions caused by extreme weather and increased flooding) and pollen (due to a longer pollen season and more pollen production).
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
What are the effects of Air Pollution?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
“While we’ve made progress over the last 40-plus years improving air quality in the U.S. thanks to the Clean Air Act, climate change will make it harder in the future to meet pollution standards, which are designed to protect health,” says Kim Knowlton, senior scientist and deputy director of the NRDC Science Center.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Smog and soot
These two are the most prevalent types of air pollution. Smog, or “ground-level ozone,” as it is more wonkily called, occurs when emissions from combusting fossil fuels react with sunlight. Soot, or “particulate matter,” is made up of tiny particles of chemicals, soil, smoke, dust, or allergens, in the form of gas or solids, that are carried in the air. The EPA’s “Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act” states, “In many parts of the United States, pollution has reduced the distance and clarity of what we see by 70 percent.” The sources of smog and soot are similar. “Both come from cars and trucks, factories, power plants, incinerators, engines—anything that combusts fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or natural gas,” Walke says. The tiniest airborne particles in soot—whether they’re in the form of gas or solids—are especially dangerous because they can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream and worsen bronchitis, lead to heart attacks, and even hasten death.

Smog can irritate the eyes and throat and also damage the lungs—especially of people who work or exercise outside, children, and senior citizens. It’s even worse for people who have asthma or allergies—these extra pollutants only intensify their symptoms and can trigger asthma attacks.
</h5></p>


<p><h5>
Hazardous air pollutants
These are either deadly or have severe health risks even in small amounts. Almost 200 are regulated by law; some of the most common are mercury, lead, dioxins, and benzene. “These are also most often emitted during gas or coal combustion, incinerating, or in the case of benzene, found in gasoline,” Walke says. Benzene, classified as a carcinogen by the EPA, can cause eye, skin, and lung irritation in the short term and blood disorders in the long term. Dioxins, more typically found in food but also present in small amounts in the air, can affect the liver in the short term and harm the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems, as well as reproductive functions. Lead in large amounts can damage children’s brains and kidneys, and even in small amounts it can affect children’s IQ and ability to learn. Mercury affects the central nervous system.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, are toxic components of traffic exhaust and wildfire smoke. In large amounts, they have been linked to eye and lung irritation, blood and liver issues, and even cancer. In one recent study, the children of mothers who’d had higher PAH exposure during pregnancy had slower brain processing speeds and worse symptoms of ADHD.
</h5></p>


<p><h5>
Greenhouse gases
By trapping the earth’s heat in the atmosphere, greenhouse gases lead to warmer temperatures and all the hallmarks of climate change: rising sea levels, more extreme weather, heat-related deaths, and increasing transmission of infectious diseases like Lyme. According to a 2014 EPA study, carbon dioxide was responsible for 81 percent of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and methane made up 11 percent. “Carbon dioxide comes from combusting fossil fuels, and methane comes from natural and industrial sources, including the large amounts that are released during oil and gas drilling,” Walke says. “We emit far larger amounts of carbon dioxide, but methane is significantly more potent, so it’s also very destructive.” Another class of greenhouse gases, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide in their ability to trap heat. In October 2016, more than 140 countries reached an agreement to reduce the use of these chemicals—which are used in air conditioners and refrigerators—and find greener alternatives over time. David Doniger, senior strategic director of NRDC’s Climate and Clean Energy program, writes, “NRDC estimates that the agreed HFC phase-down will avoid the equivalent of more than 80 billion tons of CO2 over the next 35 years.”
</h5></p>


<p><h5>
Pollen and mold
Mold and allergens from trees, weeds, and grass are also carried in the air, are exacerbated by climate change, and can be hazardous to health. They are not regulated by the government and are less directly connected to human actions, but they can be considered air pollution. “When homes, schools, or businesses get water damage, mold can grow and can produce allergenic airborne pollutants,” Knowlton says. “Mold exposure can precipitate asthma attacks or an allergic response, and some molds can even produce toxins that would be dangerous for anyone to inhale.”

Pollen allergies are worsening because of climate change. “Lab and field studies are showing that the more carbon dioxide pollen-producing plants—especially ragweed—are grown in, the bigger they grow and the more pollen they produce,” Knowlton says. “Climate change also extends the pollen production season, and some studies are beginning to suggest that ragweed pollen itself might be becoming a more potent allergen.” That means more people will suffer runny noses, fevers, itchy eyes, and other symptoms.
</h5></p>


<p><h5>
How to Help Reduce Air Pollution ?
</h5></p>


<p><h5>
“The less gasoline we burn, the better we’re doing to reduce air pollution and harmful effects of climate change,” Walke says. “Make good choices about transportation. When you can, walk, ride a bike, or take public transportation. For driving, choose cars that get better miles per gallon of gas or choose an electric car.” You can also investigate your power provider options—you may be able to request that your electricity be supplied by wind or solar. Buying your food locally cuts down on the fossil fuels burned in trucking or flying food in from across the country. And perhaps most important, “Support leaders who push for clean air and water and responsible steps on climate change,” Walke says.
</h5></p>


<p><h5>
How to Protect Your Health ?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
“When you see in the newspaper or hear on the weather report that pollution levels are high, it may be useful to limit the time when children go outside or you go for a jog,” Walke says. Generally, ozone levels tend to be lower in the morning.
</h5></p>


<p><h5>
When you do exercise outside, stay as far as you can from heavily trafficked roads. Then shower and wash your clothes to remove fine particles.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
If the air quality is bad, stay inside with windows closed.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Wear sunscreen. When ultraviolet radiation comes through the weakened ozone layer, it can cause skin damage and skin cancer.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
What Is Water Pollution?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
What Are the Causes of Water Pollution?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and brilliant blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
What Are the Effects of Water Pollution?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
On human health
To put it bluntly: Water pollution kills. In fact, it caused 1.8 million deaths in 2015, according to a study published in The Lancet. Contaminated water can also make you ill. Every year, unsafe water sickens about 1 billion people. And low-income communities are disproportionately at risk because their homes are often closest to the most polluting industries.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
On the environment
In order to thrive, healthy ecosystems rely on a complex web of animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi—all of which interact, directly or indirectly, with each other. Harm to any of these organisms can create a chain effect, imperiling entire aquatic environments.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
When water pollution causes an algal bloom in a lake or marine environment, the proliferation of newly introduced nutrients stimulates plant and algae growth, which in turn reduces oxygen levels in the water. This dearth of oxygen, known as eutrophication, suffocates plants and animals and can create “dead zones,” where waters are essentially devoid of life. In certain cases, these harmful algal blooms can also produce neurotoxins that affect wildlife, from whales to sea turtles.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Chemicals and heavy metals from industrial and municipal wastewater contaminate waterways as well. These contaminants are toxic to aquatic life—most often reducing an organism’s life span and ability to reproduce—and make their way up the food chain as predator eats prey. That’s how tuna and other big fish accumulate high quantities of toxins, such as mercury.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
What Are the Causes of Soil Pollution?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Soil pollution can be caused by the following (non-exhaustive list)

Microplastics,
Oil spills,
Mining and activities by other heavy industries,
Accidental spills may happen during activities, etc.
Corrosion of underground storage tanks (including piping used to transmit the contents),
Acid rain,
Intensive farming,
Agrochemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers,
Petrochemicals,
Industrial accidents,
Road debris,
Drainage of contaminated surface water into the soil,
Ammunitions, chemical agents, and other agents of war,
Waste disposal,
Oil and fuel dumping,
Nuclear wastes,
Direct discharge of industrial wastes to the soil,
Discharge of sewage,
Landfill and illegal dumping,
Coal ash,
Electronic waste,
Contaminated by rocks containing large amounts of toxic elements.
Contaminated by Pb due to vehicle exhaust, Cd, and Zn caused by tire wear.
Contamination by strengthening air pollutants by incineration of fossil raw materials.

<p><h5>
What Are the Effects of Soil Pollution?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Health effects:
Contaminated or polluted soil directly affects human health through direct contact with soil or via inhalation of soil contaminants which have vaporized; potentially greater threats are posed by the infiltration of soil contamination into groundwater aquifers used for human consumption, sometimes in areas apparently far removed from any apparent source of above ground contamination. This tends to result in the development of pollution-related diseases.


Health consequences from exposure to soil contamination vary greatly depending on pollutant type, pathway of attack and vulnerability of the exposed population. Chronic exposure to chromium, lead and other metals, petroleum, solvents, and many pesticide and herbicide formulations can be carcinogenic, can cause congenital disorders, or can cause other chronic health conditions. Industrial or man-made concentrations of naturally occurring substances, such as nitrate and ammonia associated with livestock manure from agricultural operations, have also been identified as health hazards in soil and groundwater.[7]

Chronic exposure to benzene at sufficient concentrations is known to be associated with higher incidence of leukemia. Mercury and cyclodienes are known to induce higher incidences of kidney damage and some irreversible diseases. PCBs and cyclodienes are linked to liver toxicity. Organophosphates and carbonates can induce a chain of responses leading to neuromuscular blockage. Many chlorinated solvents induce liver changes, kidney changes and depression of the central nervous system. There is an entire spectrum of further health effects such as headache, nausea, fatigue, eye irritation and skin rash for the above cited and other chemicals. At sufficient dosages a large number of soil contaminants can cause death by exposure via direct contact, inhalation or ingestion of contaminants in groundwater contaminated through soil.[8]

The Scottish Government has commissioned the Institute of Occupational Medicine to undertake a review of methods to assess risk to human health from contaminated land. The overall aim of the project is to work up guidance that should be useful to Scottish Local Authorities in assessing whether sites represent a significant possibility of significant harm (SPOSH) to human health. It is envisaged that the output of the project will be a short document providing high level guidance on health risk assessment with reference to existing published guidance and methodologies that have been identified as being particularly relevant and helpful. The project will examine how policy guidelines have been developed for determining the acceptability of risks to human health and propose an approach for assessing what constitutes unacceptable risk in line with the criteria for SPOSH as defined in the legislation and the Scottish Statutory Guidance.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Ecosystem effects:
Not unexpectedly, soil contaminants can have significant deleterious consequences for ecosystems.[9] There are radical soil chemistry changes which can arise from the presence of many hazardous chemicals even at low concentration of the contaminant species. These changes can manifest in the alteration of metabolism of endemic microorganisms and arthropods resident in a given soil environment. The result can be virtual eradication of some of the primary food chain, which in turn could have major consequences for predator or consumer species. Even if the chemical effect on lower life forms is small, the lower pyramid levels of the food chain may ingest alien chemicals, which normally become more concentrated for each consuming rung of the food chain. Many of these effects are now well known, such as the concentration of persistent DDT materials for avian consumers, leading to weakening of egg shells, increased chick mortality and potential extinction of species.[citation needed]

Effects occur to agricultural lands which have certain types of soil contamination. Contaminants typically alter plant metabolism, often causing a reduction in crop yields. This has a secondary effect upon soil conservation, since the languishing crops cannot shield the Earth's soil from erosion. Some of these chemical contaminants have long half-lives and in other cases derivative chemicals are formed from decay of primary soil contaminants.

<p><h5>
What Are the prevention to be taken for Soil Pollution?
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
The soil is an integral part of the natural environment. Although much concern over the years has been on air and water pollution, prevention and control of soil pollution are as important as air and water pollution control. In fact, soil can impact on air and water quality as it is home to a wide range of organisms and plays a bigger role in the distribution of plant species.

Furthermore, the soil acts as a source and a store for gases. It also influences the flow of chemical substances and water between the earth and the atmosphere. Unfortunately, over the years, human activities like the use of pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides have had an adverse effect on soil quality. In addition to agricultural pollution, industrial waste and urban activities also cause soil pollution.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
Improper disposal of industrial waste, drainage from homes and improper disposal of trash further contaminate the soil. When the soil is contaminated, it negatively affects the ecological system as plants and microorganisms may struggle to adapt to the change in the chemical composition of the soil.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
1. Get a better understanding of the soil environment quality baseline
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
In order to properly control and prevent soil erosion, it is paramount that every stakeholder understands the baseline of soil environment quality, which can be done by carrying out sensitizations and surveys on soil pollution. However, to ensure consistent results, the technical requirements for the survey should be formulated including the frequency of when the survey should be conducted.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
2. Develop necessary legislation on soil pollution control
Although efforts are being put in place to ensure soil pollution control, the process ought to be accelerated by drafting the necessary legislation. The existing registrations such as urban and rural planning, agricultural practices, and land management should be revised and updated to include contemporary soil pollution control and prevention measures.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
4. Proper Solid Waste Treatment
It is important to dispose of solid waste properly by treated it before it’s released into the environment. Acidic and alkaline waste, for example, can be neutralized before they are disposed of to avoid soil contamination. Biodegradable waste should also be broken down in a controlled environment before it is released into the environment. A great example is the proper treatment of sewage sludge.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
5. Ensure proper investigation of reclaimed land
When dealing with land that is expected to be reclaimed and used for other purposes such as the construction of residential homes or social amenities like schools as it is in the case of mining, there is need to conduct soil investigation and evaluation. The mandate of testing the contamination levels of such lands should be given to the city or government unit in charge.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
6. Strictly control the pollution of new soil
It is cheaper to prevent soil pollution than it is to manage polluted soil and thus, the appropriate objective should be protecting new soil. Before any new land is used, thorough research should be conducted to ensure whether the land is suitable for the intended use. There should also be put in place stringent measures against those who dump harmful or poisonous substances to the mudflat, sand, swampland, and salt marshes as well as those who discharge pollutants illegally.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
7. Strengthen policies that manage pollution sources
The best way to control soil pollution is to strictly control the mining and industrial pollutants. In addition to controlling the pollutants, daily environment supervision should be enhanced. This should be implemented by making a layout plan that should include close supervision on the soil environment including regular information updates. To ensure accountability, the companies in the specified area should conduct soil research at least once annually and release the information to the public.


</h5></p>

<p><h5>
8. Transfer treatment and remediation costs to polluting companies
The government should make an effort to improve the quality of soil through pollution treatment and remediation. To ensure the sustainability of the project, the individuals and companies that pollute the soil should be held responsible for the treatment and remediation costs. In case of change of the responsible subjects, the party that inherits the debt and rights should be held responsible.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
9. Embrace technological research and development
To ensure sustainability in the prevention and control of soil pollution, research on soil pollution prevention and control should be advanced by strengthening technological research. The government should integrate the resources from various research institutions and universities to support relevant research on soil environmental capacity and ecological effects of soil contamination among other possibilities.

The effort should also include promoting research on common technologies that relate to soil pollution diagnosis, research, and development of advanced data collection and mapping equipment, and soils contamination risk management and control.
</h5></p>

<p><h5>
10. Promote objective assessment and accountability among all stakeholders
To ensure long term success in the prevention and control of soil pollution, all stakeholders’ role in the implementation of the soil pollution control should be clear. All tasks should be defined and inter-departmental cooperation and coordination should be strengthened to ensure seamless implementation and immediate resolutions focused towards correct disposal of garbage, proper treatment of sewage sludge, minimized the use of agro-chemicals, reforestation, construction of drainage systems, and strengthening chemical use related laws.
